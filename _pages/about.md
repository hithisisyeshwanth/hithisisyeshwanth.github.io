Hey! Thank you for visiting my page. 
My name is Yeshwanth Neriyanuri. I live in Bengaluru, India. 

I am just a curious guy. Anything I find it interesting, be it Cancer, Astrophysics, Quantum Mechanics, Bikes, I just dig deep into the topic to understand the crux of it and enjoy that feeling of accomplishment after knowing something I didn't know before.
